## Objective

Extract and curate 42+ memorable, quotable phrases from a copywriter's body of work, organized into a 7-tier system based on usage frequency and context. These phrases become the "voice bank" that makes the AI agent sound authentically like the original copywriter.

**Key Principle:** A signature phrase must be able to stand alone, be memorable, and feel distinctly like the copywriter said it—not a generic statement anyone could make.

## PREREQUISITES

Before starting, ensure you have:

```
elicit: true
question: "Please provide the following information:"
fields:
  - copywriter_name: "Name of the copywriter"
  - source_directory: "Path to source materials"
  - primary_theme: "Main topic domain (e.g., copywriting)"
  - secondary_theme: "Second topic domain (e.g., marketing)"

```

### Required Materials

| Material | Minimum | Ideal | Purpose |
|----------|---------|-------|---------|
| Source files | 20 | 40+ | Find diverse phrases |
| Reference agent | 1 | 2 | Understand tier format |
| Theme identification | 3 | 3 | Define Tiers 3-5 |

---

## PHASE 1: RECONNAISSANCE

### Step 1.1: Inventory Source Materials

List all source files and note potential phrase richness:

| File | Type | Estimated Phrase Count | Notes |
|------|------|------------------------|-------|
| [filename] | Article/Transcript/Interview | High/Medium/Low | [Notable quotes observed] |

**Priority files for phrases:**
- Interviews (natural speech patterns)
- Social media threads (condensed wisdom)
- Book excerpts (polished statements)
- Presentation transcripts (repeated messaging)

### Step 1.2: Read Reference Agent

Study the signature_phrases section in `agents/david-ogilvy.md`:

1. Observe the 7-tier structure
2. Note phrase length patterns
3. Understand context field depth
4. See source attribution format

### Quality Gate: Reconnaissance

- [ ] All source files inventoried
- [ ] Reference agent signature_phrases section reviewed
- [ ] Three main themes identified for Tiers 3-5
- [ ] Tier names customized to copywriter's domains

---

## PHASE 2: PHRASE IDENTIFICATION

### Step 2.1: What Makes a Signature Phrase?

**A signature phrase MUST be:**

1. **Standalone** — Makes sense without context
2. **Memorable** — Sticks in your mind
3. **Original** — Distinctly theirs, not generic
4. **Quotable** — Something you'd cite or share
5. **Repeatable** — Appears multiple times OR is too good not to include

**A signature phrase must NOT be:**

1. Generic advice anyone could say
2. Incomplete thought requiring context
3. Overly technical without punch
4. Factual statement without personality
5. Too long (generally under 25 words)

### Step 2.2: Extraction Process

For each source file, extract candidate phrases using this format:

```markdown
## [Source File Name]

### Candidate Phrases

| Phrase | Tier Candidate | Frequency | Context |
|--------|----------------|-----------|---------|
| "Exact quote from source" | 1-7 | 1st/2nd/3rd occurrence | Where/when used |
```

**Extraction Rules:**

1. Copy phrases EXACTLY as written (preserve voice)
2. Mark frequency of appearance across sources
3. Note the context where it appears
4. Tag with candidate tier (can change later)
5. Err on side of over-extraction (filter later)

### Step 2.3: Frequency Analysis

Cross-reference phrases across all sources:

| Phrase | File 1 | File 2 | File 3 | ... | Total Occurrences |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|-----|-------------------|
| "[phrase]" | ✓ | ✓ | - | ... | 2 |

**Frequency indicates tier placement:**
- 5+ occurrences → Strong Tier 1 candidate
- 3-4 occurrences → Tier 2-3 candidate
- 1-2 occurrences → Tier 4-7 based on quality

### Quality Gate: Identification

- [ ] 80+ candidate phrases identified (to filter to 42)

## PHASE 4: DOCUMENTATION

### Step 4.1: Phrase Structure

```yaml
- phrase: "The exact phrase in English"
  portuguese: "Portuguese translation (if original is English, translate; if original is Portuguese, keep original)"
  context: "When and how to use this phrase - specific guidance"
  source: "Source file or content piece where this was found"
```

### Step 4.2: Context Guidelines

The `context` field should answer:

- **How** to integrate into copy/conversation

**Good context example:**
```yaml
context: "Use when explaining why short-term thinking fails. Works well in sales pages when addressing instant gratification objections."
```

**Bad context example:**
```yaml
context: "Business advice" # Too vague
```

### Step 4.3: Source Attribution

The `source` field should identify:
- Original file name OR
- Content piece title OR
- "Multiple sources" (for high-frequency phrases)

Use template: `templates/signature-phrases-tmpl.yaml`

Structure:
```yaml

## TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue: Not Enough Phrases Found

**Symptoms:** Can't reach 42 quality phrases

**Solutions:**
1. Review source files for indirect quotes (paraphrased wisdom)
2. Look for repeated concepts expressed differently
3. Check interviews/transcripts for spoken patterns
4. Supplement with social media/short-form content

### Issue: Too Many Similar Phrases

**Symptoms:** Multiple phrases saying the same thing

**Solutions:**
1. Keep the most memorable version only
2. Merge similar phrases into one
3. Choose based on frequency (most repeated wins)
4. Select based on quotability

### Issue: Phrases Feel Generic

**Symptoms:** Phrases could be said by anyone

**Solutions:**
1. Look for unique vocabulary
2. Find more specific versions
3. Add context that shows uniqueness
4. Replace with more distinctive alternatives

### Issue: Unbalanced Tier Distribution

**Symptoms:** Some tiers have too many/few phrases

**Solutions:**
1. Re-evaluate tier assignments
2. Some phrases may fit multiple tiers—choose strategically
3. If a theme is weak, consider merging with another
4. Adjust tier themes to match source material better
